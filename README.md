# Bark Parks 
Final Bootcamp Project

Bark Parks is a web dedicated to those hairy friends we call dogs.
Through it, your pupper will be able to know when and where are its friends, and tell them too, so together you can go out, play and socialize.
It will tell you about the dog spots in your area and about shelters you can go to adopt a dog or help as a volunteer.

To run it locally, open 2 terminals (or cmd if in windows), go to the client folder on one, to the server on the other (cd server and cd client if you are already in the global project folder)
then run first npm i on both, to install node modules
when done, run npm start on both terminals. the client one should open a browser window. If it doesn't, paste this url in your browser
http://localhost:3000/
the server should be running on http://localhost:3500/


you can try the whole project here https://bark-parks.netlify.app/

If you are wondering why the repo was splitted for deployment, it's because I wanted to learn how to deploy on netlify and heroku and make them work together

have fun with your doggo!
