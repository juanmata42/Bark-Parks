Bark Parks is a web dedicated to those hairy friends we call dogs.
Through it, your pupper will be able to know when and where are its friends, and tell them too, so together you can go out, play and socialize.
It will tell you about the dog spots in your area and about shelters you can go to adopt a dog or help as a volunteer.
